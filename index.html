        <h6>During the late 1960s, after graduating from UC Davis (BA, 1966; MA, 1967) and moving to New York, Stephen Kaltenbach established a reputation in the emerging international field of Conceptual art. But in 1970, just as he was achieving career
          success, Kaltenbach abruptly withdrew to California’s Central Valley, appearing to abandon Conceptual work in favor of the more traditional mediums of painting and sculpture. Coinciding with the 50th anniversary of his “dropout,” this
          exhibition considers Kaltenbach’s engagement with time as a principal theme across his remarkably diverse career, which encompasses bronze time capsules, advertisements placed anonymously in Artforum magazine in 1968-69, and the monumental
          photorealist painting Portrait of My Father (1972-79)</h6>
